Question?: 
- Not have all the previous exams or something? 
- category and topic (functions, conditionals, loops, integers, list) *forced list
- minimum of test cases 2, max of 5

```python
def operation(op, a, b):
    if op == "+":
        return a+b
    elif op == "-"
        return a - b 
    elif op == "*"
        return a * b
    elif op == "/"
        return a/b
    else:
        return -1
```
1. 
- split screen (filter by topic, difficulty, key word (on right side))
- constraint (for, while, recursion) (can have or not have) {extra} (deduct points)
    - do all the test and check if `for`, `while` or `func name is repeated` or some
