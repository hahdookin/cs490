Question?: 
- Not have all the previous exams or something? 
- category and topic (functions, conditionals, loops, integers, list) *forced list
- minimum of test cases 2, max of 5

```python
def operation(op, a, b):
    if op == "+":
        return a+b
    elif op == "-"
        return a - b 
    elif op == "*"
        return a * b
    elif op == "/"
        return a/b
    else:
        return -1
```
1. 
- split screen (filter by topic, difficulty, key word (on right side))
- constraint (for, while, recursion) (can have or not have) {extra} (deduct points)
    - do all the test and check if `for`, `while` or `func name is repeated` or some 


1. Select and pop over or drag quesiton 

1. List Points, minimap (component that follows you around)

1. One table per question (anything for points should be a row)
    - Rows:
        - Function
        - Constraint 
        - Testcases
        - Comment
    - Column
        - Input
        - Ouput
        - Worth
        - Autograde
        - Override 
        - Color

## New Stuff

- [ ] Constraints (for, while, recursion)
    - Bonus: Comment preprocessing (NOT GRADED)

- [ ] Split-Screen (Filter by topic, keyword, difficulty)
- To make questions from bank

- [x] Show points to students (how much each question is worth)
    - BONUS: mini-maps to show where questions (follow around)

- [x] Autograder -> One table for each student questions

- [x] Student seeing the result
